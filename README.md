# DD2424 Deep Learning in Data Science Assignment 4

The aim of this assignment is to train a RNN (recurrent neural network) to synthesize English text (from Harry Potter snippets) character by character and to synthesize Donald Trump Tweets. This was approached is two methods: with a vanilla RNN and a LSTM (long short-term memory).

## Harry Potter Text
### Results 

The following is a synthesized 1,000-character text made from the best RNN model during training, based on the minimum loss value.  The model was trained for 30 epochs.
